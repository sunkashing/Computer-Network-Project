Project1 brief design:

a. Your docoder design:
	Basically, I inversed the 4 levels of the transmitter. Unpacking the message from level 4 to level 1.

b. How did you infer the length of the packet?
	I used find peak function in Matlab to get the first and last peak of the incoming signal (there's a threshold peak value to determine whether is a valid peak or not), and the difference between them is the length of the packet.

c. Libraries used:
	None

d. Extra capabilities you implemented:
	None

e. Extra instructions on how to execute the code:
	None
